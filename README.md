Searches a folder (and subfolders) of Yamaha DX7 sysex patch dump files for a provided term, and creates new patch dump sysex files of all patches containing that term. Also outputs a .txt file to show where each patch came from.

To use, place dx_search.py in the root of your DX7 patch folder. All files will be output to <DX7_Patch_Folder>/dx_search/<Search_Term>
